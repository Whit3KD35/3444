# Project Idea
We are making a website/app that will help users with studying to minimize test anxiety by providing multiple ways to prep for tests so the user can maximize his study time
We want a simplistic UI that is easy to move through, and provides stats for the user on his study time
The app should be able to give optimal time for studying, and within the studying sphere, should provide 3 types of study games (memory, match, quick fire questions(faster you answer more points you get)), flash cards, and practice problems.
